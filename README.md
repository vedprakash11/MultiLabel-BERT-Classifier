## About the Competition
The goal of this competition is to assess the language proficiency of 8th-12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs). Utilizing a dataset of essays written by ELLs will help to develop proficiency models that better supports all students.

Your work will help ELLs receive more accurate feedback on their language development and expedite the grading cycle for teachers. These outcomes could enable ELLs to receive more appropriate learning tasks that will help them improve their English language proficiency.
